\section{Abstract}
Analytics have become prominent in usage in professional sports within the last two decades. One of the sports that has seen the most advancement within the field is baseball. However, there are various areas within the game of baseball that have had limited research and which are contributing to major inefficiencies at the professional level. A prominent one of these is injuries, particularly to pitchers but also to position players. This paper will attempt to use available historical injury data as well as existing player and performance data to find significant factors contributing to player injury, and lead insights on how these can be improved.
